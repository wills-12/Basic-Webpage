# Frontend Developer Portfolio

This is a simple HTML and CSS portfolio website for a Frontend Developer. The project showcases the developer's skills, projects, work experience, education, and reviews from teachers. The website is structured with semantic HTML.

## Features

- **Multiple Pages**: The website includes four pages:
  - Homepage (`index.html`): Displays an overview of the developer, projects, work experience, education, and reviews.
  - Projects (`projects.html`): Lists the developer's projects in detail.
  - Articles (`articles.html`): Placeholder for articles written by the developer.
  - Contact (`contact.html`): Includes a form for visitors to send messages.
- **Semantic HTML**: The website uses semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) for better structure and accessibility.
- **SEO Meta Tags**: Each page includes SEO meta tags (`description`, `keywords`, `author`) for better search engine visibility.

## Project Goals

This project was created to achieve the following goals:

- Learn how to create a multi-page website using HTML.
