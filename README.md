# Basic-Webpage

Let’s create a README.md file for your project. A README file is essential for documenting your project, providing instructions on how to set it up, and explaining its purpose and features. Since this is a simple HTML and CSS portfolio website, the README will include sections for the project description, features, setup instructions, file structure, usage, and any additional notes.

I’ll write the README in Markdown format (.md), which is commonly used for documentation on platforms like GitHub.

# Frontend Developer Portfolio

This is a simple HTML and CSS portfolio website for a Frontend Developer. The project showcases the developer's skills, projects, work experience, education, and reviews from teachers. The website is structured with semantic HTML and styled with CSS to be mobile-responsive, following a provided mockup design.

## Features

- **Multiple Pages**: The website includes four pages:
  - Homepage (`index.html`): Displays an overview of the developer, projects, work experience, education, and reviews.
  - Projects (`projects.html`): Lists the developer's projects in detail.
  - Articles (`articles.html`): Placeholder for articles written by the developer.
  - Contact (`contact.html`): Includes a form for visitors to send messages.
- **Semantic HTML**: The website uses semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) for better structure and accessibility.
- **Navigation Bar**: A consistent navigation bar is present on all pages, linking to Home, Projects, Articles, and Contact.
- **SEO Meta Tags**: Each page includes SEO meta tags (`description`, `keywords`, `author`) for better search engine visibility.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: The website is styled with CSS to be fully responsive, adjusting layouts for different screen sizes (e.g., navigation bar stacks vertically on mobile).
- **Clean Design**: The CSS provides a professional, clean look with a layout that matches the provided mockup, including a grid for projects, boxed sections for work experience and reviews, and a centered contact form.

## Project Goals

This project was created to achieve the following goals:

- Learn how to create a multi-page website using HTML.
- Structure a website with semantic HTML for accessibility and future styling.
- Add SEO meta tags to improve search engine optimization.
- Style the website with CSS to match a provided mockup.
- Ensure the website is mobile-responsive using CSS techniques like media queries and flexible layouts.

## File Structure

frontend-portfolio/
├── index.html # Homepage
├── projects.html # Projects page
├── articles.html # Articles page
├── contact.html # Contact page with a form
├── styles.css # CSS file for styling all pages
└── README.md # Project documentation

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download the Project**:

   - If using Git, clone the repository:
     bash
     git clone <repository-url>
   - Alternatively, download the project files as a ZIP and extract them.

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   bash
   cd frontend-portfolio

3. **Open the Website**:

   - Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the Homepage.
   - Use the navigation bar to visit other pages (Projects, Articles, Contact).

4. **Optional: Serve Locally**:
   - To view the website as if it were hosted on a server, you can use a local server. For example, with Python:
     bash
     python -m http.server 8000
   - Then, open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Usage

- **Homepage (`index.html`)**: View the developer's introduction, projects, work experience, education, and reviews.
- **Projects (`projects.html`)**: Explore detailed descriptions of the developer's projects.
- **Articles (`articles.html`)**: Read articles written by the developer (currently placeholders).
- **Contact (`contact.html`)**: Use the form to send a message (note: the form is not functional without a backend; it’s for demonstration purposes).
- **Responsiveness**: Test the website on different devices or use your browser’s developer tools to simulate mobile views.

## Customization

- **Update Content**: Replace placeholders like `[Your Name]` in `index.html` with your actual name. Update project descriptions, work experience, education, and reviews with your own information.
- **Styling**: Modify `styles.css` to change colors, fonts, or spacing. For example, change the primary color (`#007bff`) to a different color for links and buttons.
- **Add Functionality**: Add JavaScript to make the contact form functional (e.g., by integrating with a backend or a service like Formspree).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the website structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling and mobile responsiveness.

## Screenshots

_(You can add screenshots of the website here if desired. For example, take a screenshot of the Homepage on desktop and mobile, upload them to the repository, and link them here.)_

## Notes

- The contact form is currently a static HTML form and requires a backend to process submissions. You can integrate it with a service like Formspree or add a backend server to handle form submissions.
- The website is styled to match the provided mockup but can be further customized to match your personal branding.
- The project is HTML and CSS only, as per the requirements. JavaScript can be added for additional interactivity if needed.
